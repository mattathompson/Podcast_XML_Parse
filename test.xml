The very thought of this staple in church design, brings to mind the beautiful architecture that dominated sacred spaces for the majority of church history. These windows, however, had a purpose much larger than aesthetic. By the masterful assembling of many unique pieces of glass, these windows served as the primary method of teaching the written stories of the Bible to an illiterate world. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, the book of Acts tells the story of Jesus assembling broken people together to communicate a beautiful story of redemption to a dark and ailing world. Like the sun shining through stained glass renders stories of God's plan for humanity; today, Jesus is shining through his church, demonstrating how a broken life, in the hands of the master, can be made beautiful.
